ANALYSIS AND FORECAST OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR TWO BUILDINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MILAN-BICOCCA
# Overview
For this project we tried to analyze the trend in terms of energy consumption of two specific buildings of the Bicocca University (Milan), namely U1 and U6, located about 550 meters apart. Furthermore, with the data available, referring in time to the years between 2018 and 2020, it was also possible to obtain information on the effect of Covid on the energy trend of this portion of the university. However, information relating to Bicocca's energy saving policies was taken into consideration to better contextualise the analysis and understand the nature of the results. In addition, an integration was made with some meteorological data from the ARPA station in Viale Marche.
For the analyzes we used the Arima and Sarima models and for further investigations Random Forest and RNN LSTM.
